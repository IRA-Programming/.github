## Rules
To maintain the organization and prevent any messes, we ask that you follow these rules:

### Don't Commit Code Unless You Get Permission
Since this organization has many templates and example projects, it is not allowed to upload code to these repositories **unless** you are given permission. 
This includes uploading entire repositories.

To get permission, you can ask these people:
1. Mr. Hoang
2. Any of the C++ teachers
3. People in the mentor's team

#### Important!
If you have your own repository with your code here, you are allowed to freely push, edit, and pull your code!

### If you see an issue, point it out
There might be issues with the class resources. If you see it, you are free to create an issue to report it. This will gain the attention of the mentors/teachers and they will fix it. Additionally, if you are in class, tell your mentor/teacher directly too.

### Use common sense
Please use common sense when using anything from this organization. This means (but is not limited to):
* Use proper language
* Name commits with names that correlate to what they do
* Follow the rules
* Think before you act
