# Welcome

This is the IRA Programming GitHub Organization! While you take your class, you can use this organization to access certain resources and push your code from class!

## Rules
To maintain the organization and prevent any messes, we ask that you follow these rules:

### Don't Commit Code Unless You Get Permission
Since this organization has many templates and example projects, it is not allowed to upload code to these repositories **unless** you are given permission. 
This includes uploading entire repositories.

To get permission, you can ask these people:
1. Mr. Hoang
2. Any of the C++ teachers
3. People in the mentors team
